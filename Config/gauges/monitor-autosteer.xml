			<!--
			Logically this function would be built into "button-autosteer.xml". The problem you have is the button state
			is important even thoiugh it is not visible on the panel. When the button is ON, it becomes an "active" 
			device that responds to external stimulus (steering) regardless if the AUTO-STEER button is visible or not.

			If auto steer is enabled, then determine which camera should be in control. The camera will be selected
			by setting the appropriate event. The event is defined as if a button was pressed. To see the actual event
			implementation, see one of the following:
				button-camera_frontcenter.xml
				button-camera_frontleft.xml
				button-camera_frontright.xml
